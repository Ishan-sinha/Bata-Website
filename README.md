# Bata Website

This is a part of my introductory web development project which contains the front end of a sample website dedicated towards Bata (a footwear brand). This project was aimed to analyze the constraints in the collapsing market share of Bata and to improve it.
Bata is an international footwear brand operating in India since 1931 and had a great brand value due to word of mouth among it's customers and had strong hold among it's customers due to extensive shops and showroom centres throughout the nation. While Bata was doing great on it's sales upto the first decade of 21st century, it saw a collapsing market share in the second decade due to absence from e-marketing.
With the growth of e-commerce website like Amazon, flipkart, Myntra, etc. The non-alignment of Bata with these e-commerce website made it's share of market to deplete gradually.

## Problem Statement

Absence of Bata on the internet and from e-marketing portals. Though off lately, Bata has showed up on many e-commerce websites, it still lacks a dedicated website for it's footwear sales in India. This project aims to fulfill the same.
